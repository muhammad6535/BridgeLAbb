Main Problem:
Finding the right items to
buy while shopping online
Addressing the problem
● Online shoppers face too many options and
inconsistent information
● Reviews are unreliable, biased, or overwhelming
● Filters focus on price and brand — not real needs or
context
● Result: frustration, wrong purchases, returns, and loss
of trust

Why now?
● Online shopping has grown rapidly since COVID-19,
especially in fashion
● Consumers now buy clothes and shoes without seeing or
trying them first
● This has led to a return crisis — up to 40% of online
fashion purchases are returned
● Returns create high costs, wasted time, complex
logistics, and major environmental impact
what is the gap with the
existing solutions?
● While they help, most of them don’t show true
3D fit:
● They are 2D overlays, not real simulations.
● They don’t adapt to individual body shapes.
● They don’t show movement, drape, or real
material behavior.
● Fit recommendations can still be inaccurate.
● That’s exactly the gap a proper 3D solution
would fill.
The solution
Show how you solve the
problem you identified.
What will be different when
the problem is solved (by
you)?
The technology:
How it works
Step 1: User Flow
● User uploads 2-3 photos and basic details (height, weight).
● System analyzes images to estimate body shape and measurements.
● A realistic 3D digital twin of the user is generated.
● Clothing is mapped onto the digital twin for virtual try-on.
● AI recommends the best size using the brand’s size guide.
● Delivered as a plug-in/widget for e-commerce fashion websites.
How it works
Step 1: User Flow
Step 2: Technologies Used
Front-end:
● Web app interface for photo upload, preview, and virtual try-on.
How it works
Step 3: Back-end:
Step 1: User Flow
Step 2: Technologies Used
● Image analysis (body shape
estimation).
● 3D avatar/digital twin
generation and clothing
simulation.
● AI-based size
recommendation engine.
